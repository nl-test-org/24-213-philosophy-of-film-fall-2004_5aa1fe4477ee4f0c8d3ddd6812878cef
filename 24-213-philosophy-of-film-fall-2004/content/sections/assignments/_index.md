No quizzes or exams, but students are required to attend every class, (whether or not there are conflicting exams or study groups in other courses), arrive on time, and do the assigned reading for each weekly session. Attendance, lateness, class participation will be a consideration in the final grade. Two papers are required: one, due session 10, will be at least 1500 words long (as indicated by the computer word-count on the first page) and consisting of an analysis of one or more week's class work on the list above and scheduled up to the tenth class session, plus some outside research. The second paper will be due on the final class session and will deal in a more original way with a philosophical theme, as discussed in advance with the instructor and approved by him. This paper will be at least 2000 words long (as indicated by the computer word-count on the first page). Both papers are to be double-spaced (28 pts) and with a font of 14 pts.
